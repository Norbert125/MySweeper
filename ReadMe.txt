Hy, i'm a second year software development university student, and i have made this little game as one of my side project.
I made it to be really low level and to run clearly and fast on most environments.
Playing the game is pretty easy, just open the MySweeper.exe and enyoj the game.
You can dig with left mouse button and put flags with the right mouse button.
The rules are pretty simple: dig in a bomb and you loose, flag all of them and you win.

I hope that whoever is reading this lives a good life and can enjoy this little game made by me, on my journey of software development. 
ENJOY :)
